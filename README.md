# DOCSTRING
Author: Adolf Stary

Title: WellnessTracker

Purpose: This project was created as a capstone project for my Full Stack Developer course at University of Alberta. It involves the full scope of full stack development using CodeFirst C# EntityFramework back end, React/JavaScript front end and MariaDB. This app was designed for personal use, to track health and wellness related events throughout the day with ease and assist with summaries and overviews of the data.

Problem this app solves: I find it quite hard to keep relevant notes about my day and then organizing and searching data when I feel off and need to find out what caused it. 
How this app solves the problem: This app makes data entry, search and getting an overview very simple. It's quick and convenient, it handles a lot of data and manipulates it in a way, which makes it is easy to navigate through it.

# Scope
- basic profile creation and authentication - ACHIEVED
- making entries into a notebook, which save important data about day's events and meals - ACHIEVED
- raw data display (Notebook.js) - ACHIEVED
- diabetic and non-diabetic version - ACHIEVED
- filtered reports - ACHIEVED (Summary.js + Today.js + Notebook.js(filtering))
- advanced observations - ACHIEVED (Summary.js Observations section, using data to determine, which allergens may be causing sickness, tiredness, etc.)

# Out of Scope
- comparisons to general charts - SCRAPPED, general charts not useful for individuals, didn't want to get on the thin ice of making suggestions how much to eat etc. Should be handled by practitioner or dietitian

# Installation instructions
- Set your own database details in EntryContext.cs, run dotnet ef database update

# Testing instructions
General filters (See controllers for filtering and data sanitation, html form inputs have basic type filtering(number, text, date)):
        - Inputs are filtered for: "*", "=", couple swear words and ";". ";" is allowed if the input also contains "http", to allow saving links to articles in entry notes. - Try entering "=" in entry notes.
        - When creating a profile, username cannot already exist in database. - Try creating a profile with username "Adolf"
        - Entered data needs to be in range - Try sending out of range requests to API in Postman
        - All referenced entities must exist - Try sending out of range requests to API in Postman
        - Passed UserID must be in uuid4 format (36 characters long) - Try sending out of range requests to API in Postman, or edit your sessionStorage in dev tools to alter your userID
        - All values sent to API must successfully parse, otherwise Exception is returned. - Try sending out of range requests to API in Postman

- There are two default profiles for testing:
        - Username: Adolf
        - Password: AdaAya
        - User is diabetic, has access to diabetic options

        - Username: Ummer
        - Password: aaa
        - User is not a diabetic, doesn't have diabetic options showing.
- There are few default entries of different types for each user allowing you to access and filter them in 'My Notebook' section and to view 'Summary'.
- To test "Observations" in "Summary", you need to make at least a couple "Meal" entries and specify allergens consumed. Then you need to create a negative status / feeling entry dated within 3 hours after the Meal entries.
        For example:
                - Create a meal at 9 AM today, where you "consumed" milk as allergen.
                - Create a meal at 9:15 AM today, where you "consumed" milk and gluten as allergen.
                - Create a meal at 9:20 AM today, where you "consumed" milk and egg as allergen.
                - Create an event at 10:00 AM today, where your status is any of the negative options, for example "Tired".
                - Visit "Summary" page to view Observation section for results;
- To test 'Today' you may need to 'Make Entry' the today to see the functionality of the section.
- Feel free to experiment, or even create your own account.

- SHA256 hashing - EntryController.cs
        // Borrowed code from: https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/hashing-passwords-in-net-core-with-tips/
        // I used this code block as it would be hard to rewrite it on my own and make it any more different.
        // Method makes SHA256 class, using standard UTF8 encoding it breaks down the given string into bytes and hashes them, then it replaces "-" with empty space
        // Which returns SHA256 hash

        // Had to modify to make it work for my own use. 
        //I got heavily inspired as I didn't know how to more simplify the code to achieve same result.

# DOCSTRING
Author: Adolf Stary

Title:

Purpose: This project was created as a capstone project for my Full Stack Developer course at University of Alberta. It involves the full scope of full stack development using C# MVC back end, React/JavaScript front end and MariaDB. This app was designed for personal use, to track health and wellness related events throughout the day with ease and assist with summaries and overviews of the data.

# Testing instructions
- Set your own database details in EntryContext.cs, run dotnet ef database update
- There are two default profiles for testing:
        - Username: Adolf
        - Password: AdaAya
        - User is diabetic, has access to diabetic options

        - Username: Ummer
        - Password: aaa
        - User is not a diabetic, doesn't have diabetic options showing.
- There are few default entries of different types for each user allowing you to access and filter them in 'My Notebook' section and to view 'Summary'.
- To test 'Today' you will need to 'Make Entry' the same day to see the functionality of the section.
- Feel free to experiment, or even create your own account.

- SHA256 hashing - EntryController.cs
        // Borrowed code from: https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/hashing-passwords-in-net-core-with-tips/
        // I used this code block as it would be hard to rewrite it on my own and make it any more different.
        // Method makes SHA256 class, using standard UTF8 encoding it breaks down the given string into bytes and hashes them, then it replaces "-" with empty space
        // Which returns SHA256 hash

- Default DateTime-Local - MakeEntry.js
        // Got heavily inspired at : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24468518/html5-input-datetime-local-default-value-of-today-and-current-time
        // Had to modify to make it work for my own use. 
        //I got heavily inspired as I didn't know how to more simplify the code to achieve same result.
        // Method suggests creating new date, setting time straight according to timezone and then assigning as value to
        // Datetime-local input by converting it to ISOString.
